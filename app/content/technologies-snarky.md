I built the AI chat on this site, it uses modern tech things; aren't I cool? I also know a bunch of other tech.

### Actively Using

- Only what I'm allowed to install
- Anything Javscript-related
- Exactly what's in your job description

### Previously Used

- Things that you think are impressive
- jQuery, but it's like still relevant right?
