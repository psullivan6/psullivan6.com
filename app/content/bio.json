      "I'm a software engineer who spends way too much time making pixels dance and convincing computers to behave. If you've ever wondered who builds those interactive websites for brands like Jack in the Box, Nickelodeon, Charlotte's Got a Lot, or Lowe'sâ€”yep, guilty as charged.",
      "Started out on the West Coast, survived college as an Oregon Duck (quack, quack), and now I juggle code, caffeine, and the occasional outdoor adventure with family and friends. Collaboration? Sure, as long as there's good Wi-Fi and better snacks."
