## Words that kinda describe me

Why use Claude to write your bio when you can just rage code for 14 hours and write whatever your comes to mind?

So &hellip; I write code. I review code. I make pitch decks. I sit on decks. I walk into forests and contemplate why I code for a living and how I can survive off berries and tree bark. I realize I have a family to feed and rent to pay and then code more. Please read this and think I'm witty and charming.
