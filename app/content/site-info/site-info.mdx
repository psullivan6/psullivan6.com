## Tech Stack

- Next.js v16
- React v19
- Tailwind CSS v4
- shadcn UI components v3 (`radix` and `ai` components)
- Tanstack Form v1
- @modelcontextprotocol SDK v1

### Reasoning

I chose Next.js since it handles `.mdx` well with minimal setup. The site content is almost all Markdown and MDX files, because:

- they're easy to edit and keep up to date, which I struggle to do
- they are easy for LLMs to read, so I can use the same content for the humans AND the bots
- there's a basic constraint with the types of formatting, ensuring consistent content and prevents me from trying to do too many fancy things
