## Tech Stack

- Next.js v16
- React v19
- Tailwind CSS v4
- shadcn UI components v3 (Radix and ai components)
- Tanstack Form v1
- @modelcontextprotocol SDK v1

### Reasoning

I chose Next.js since it's a mature, well-documented framework that easily supports Markdown and MDX rendering. I also like Tanstack Start, but it's intentionally unopinionated when it comes to Markdown and MDX, so I'd have to futz with remark and other tools, which is potentially worth it, but would slow me down more than I was willing.
